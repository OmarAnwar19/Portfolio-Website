# Personal Porfolio

All of the code and files for my personal portfolio. The root includes two folders, the desgin, with a quick mock-up of a potential website desgin created prior to the actual development process, aswell as the actual portfolio source code.

## Tech Stack

- The design of the portfolio was created primarily using Vectornator on an IPad.

- The portfolio itself was created using a varied tech stack, primarily using ReactJs, and NextJs for the actual site and routing, aswell as Material-UI and Tailwind-CSS for the styling and components throughout.

### Future Improvements / Bugs

- Dark mode causes a bug where the scroll down fab's aswell as the contact button inherit the color of their background.

- The message field of the contact form's placeholder text blends into the background on dark mode.
